Ansible Changes By Release
==========================

2.4 "Dancing Days" - ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
---------------------------------------

Major Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Support for Python-2.4 and Python-2.5 on the managed system's side
   was dropped. If you need to manage a system that ships with
   Python-2.4 or Python-2.5, you'll need to install Python-2.6 or better
   on the managed system or run Ansible-2.3 until you can upgrade the
   system.
-  New import/include keywords to replace the old bare ``include``
   directives. The use of ``static: {yes|no}`` on such includes is now
   deprecated.

   -  Using ``import_*`` (``import_playbook``, ``import_tasks``,
      ``import_role``) directives are static.
   -  Using ``include_*`` (``include_tasks``, ``include_role``)
      directives are dynamic.

-  Added fact namespacing, from now on facts will be available under
   ``ansible_facts`` namespace (i.e.
   ``ansible_facts.ansible_os_distribution``). They will continue to be
   added into the main namespace directly, but now a configuration
   toggle to disable this, currently off by default, in the future it
   will be on by default. This is done to avoid collisions and possible
   security issues as facts come from the remote targets and they might
   be compromised.
-  New ``order`` play level keyword that allows the user to change the
   order in which Ansible processes hosts when dispatching tasks.
-  Users can now set group merge priority for groups of the same depth
   (parent child relationship), using the new ``ansible_group_priority``
   variable, when values are the same or don't exist it will fallback to
   the previous sorting by name'.
-  Inventory has been revamped:
-  Inventory classes have been split to allow for better management and
   deduplication
-  Logic that each inventory source duplicated is now common and pushed
   up to reconciliation
-  VariableManager has been updated for better interaction with
   inventory
-  Updated CLI with helper method to initialize base objects for plays
-  New inventory plugins for creating inventory
-  Old inventory formats are still supported via plugins
-  Inline host\_list is also an inventory plugin, an example alternative
   ``advanced_host_list`` is also provided (it supports ranges)
-  New configuration option to list enabled plugins and precedence
   order: ``whitelist_inventory`` in ansible.cfg
-  vars\_plugins have been reworked, they are now run from Vars manager
   and API has changed (need docs)
-  Loading group\_vars/host\_vars is now a vars plugin and can be
   overridden
-  It is now possible to specify mulitple inventory sources in the
   command line (-i /etc/hosts1 -i /opt/hosts2)
-  Inventory plugins can use the cache plugin (i.e. virtualbox) and is
   affected by ``meta: refresh_inventory``
-  Group variable precedence is now configurable via new 'precedence'
   option in ansible.cfg (needs docs)
-  Improved warnings and error messages across the board
-  Configuration has been changed from a hardcoded into the constants
   module to dynamically loaded from yaml definitions
-  Also added an ansible-config CLI to allow for listing config options
   and dumping current config (including origin)
-  TODO: build upon this to add many features detailed in ansible-config
   proposal https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/35
-  Windows modules now support the use of multiple shared module\_utils
   files in the form of Powershell modules (.psm1), via
   ``#Requires -Module Ansible.ModuleUtils.Whatever.psm1``
-  Python module argument\_spec now supports custom validation logic by
   accepting a callable as the ``type`` argument.
-  Windows become\_method: runas now works across all authtypes and will
   auto-elevate under UAC if WinRM user has "Act as part of the
   operating system" privilege

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The behaviour when specifying ``--tags`` (or ``--skip-tags``)
   multiple times on the command line has changed so that the tags are
   merged together by default. See the documentation for how to
   temporarily use the old behaviour if needed:
   https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro\_configuration.html#merge-multiple-cli-tags
-  The ``fetch`` module's ``validate_md5`` parameter has been deprecated
   and will be removed in 2.8. If you wish to disable post-validation of
   the downloaded file, use validate\_checksum instead.
-  Those using ansible as a library should note that the
   ``ansible.vars.unsafe_proxy`` module is deprecated and slated to go
   away in 2.8. The functionality has been moved to
   ``ansible.utils.unsafe_proxy`` to avoid a circular import.
-  The win\_get\_url module has the dictionary 'win\_get\_url' in its
   results deprecated, its content is now also available directly in the
   resulting output, like other modules.

Deprecated Modules (to be removed in 2.8):
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  ec2\_facts: replaced by ec2\_metadata\_facts
-  cs\_nic: replaced by cs\_instance\_nic\_secondaryip, also see new
   module cs\_instance\_nic for managing nics
-  panos\_address: use M(panos\_object) instead
-  panos\_service: use M(panos\_object) instead
-  panos\_security\_policy: use M(panos\_security\_rule) instead
-  panos\_nat\_policy: use M(panos\_nat\_rule) instead
-  s3: replaced by aws\_s3
-  ec2\_remote\_facts: replaced by
-  win\_msi: use M(win\_package) instead

Removed Modules (previouslly deprecated):
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  eos\_template: use eos\_config instead
-  ios\_template: use ios\_config instead
-  iosxr\_template: use iosxr\_config instead
-  junos\_template: use junos\_config instead
-  nxos\_template: use nxos\_config instead
-  ops\_template: use ops\_config instead
-  openswitch

Minor Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Removed previously deprecated config option ``hostfile`` and env var
   ``ANSIBLE_HOSTS``
-  Removed unused and deprecated config option ``pattern``
-  Updated the copy of six bundled for modules to use from 1.4.1 to
   1.10.0
-  The ``include_dir`` var is not a global anymore, as we now allow
   multiple inventory sources, it is now host dependant. This means it
   cannot be used wherever host vars are not permitted, for example in
   task/handler names.
-  Fixed a cornercase with ini inventory vars. Previously, if an
   inventory var was a quoted string with hash marks ("#") in it then
   the parsed string included the quotes. Now the string will not be
   quoted. Previously, if the quoting ended before the string finished
   and then the hash mark appeared, the hash mark was included as part
   of the string. Now it is treated as a trailing comment:

   # Before: var1="string#comment" ===> var1: ""string#comment""
   var1="string" #comment ===> var1: ""string" #comment" # After:
   var1="string#comment" ===> var1: "string#comment" var1="string"
   #comment ===> var1: "string"

The new behaviour mirrors how the variables would appear if there was no
hash mark in the string. \* As of 2.4.0, the fetch module fails if there
are errors reading the remote file. Use ``ignore_errors`` or
``failed_when`` in playbooks if you wish to ignore errors. \*
Experimentally added pmrun become method. \* Enable the docker
connection plugin to use su as a become method \* Add an encoding
parameter for the replace module so that it can operate on non-utf-8
files \* By default, Ansible now uses the cryptography module to
implement vault instead of the older pycrypto module. \* Changed task
state resulting from both ``rc`` and ``failed`` fields returned, 'rc' no
longer overrides 'failed'. Test plugins have also been updated
accordingly. \* The win\_unzip module no longer includes dictionary
'win\_unzip' in its results, the content is now directly in the
resulting output, like pretty much every other module. \* Rewrite of the
copy module so that it handles cornercases with symbolic links and empty
directories. The copy module has a new parameter, ``local_follow`` which
controls how links on the source system are treated. (The older
parameter, follow is for links on the remote system.) \* Update the
handling of symbolic file permissions in file-related mode parameters to
deal with multiple operators. For instance, ``mode='u=rw+x-X'`` to set
the execute bit on directories, remove it from filea, and set read-write
on both is now supported \* Added better cookie parsing to
fetch\_url/open\_url. Cookies are now in a dictionary named ``cookies``
in the fetch\_url result. Anything using ``open_url`` directly can pass
a cookie object as a named arg (``cookies``), and then parse/format the
cookies in the result. \* The bundled copy of six in
lib/ansible/module\_utils/six is now used unconditionally. The code to
fallback on a system six interfered with static analysis of the code so
the cost of using the fallback code became too high. Distributions which
wish to unbundle may do so by replacing the bundled six in
ansible/module\_utils/six/\ **init**.py. Six is tricky to unbundle,
however, so they may want to base their efforts off the code we were
using: \*
https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/2fff690caab6a1c6a81973f704be3fbd0bde2c2f/lib/ansible/module\_utils/six/\ **init**.py
\* Update ipaddr Jinja filters to replace existing non RFC compliant
ones. Added additional filters for easier use of handling IP addresses.
(PR# 26566) \* datetime filter updated to use default format of
datetime.datetime (ISO8601) \* The junit plugin now has an option to
report a junit test failure on changes for idempotent testing. \* New
'diff' keyword allows setting diff mode on playbook objects, overriding
command line option and config. \* New config settings for inventory to:
- control inventory plugins used - extensions of files to ignore when
using inventory directory - patterns of flies to ignore when using
inventory directory - option to toggle failed inventory source parsing
between an error or a warning

Module Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The docker\_container module has gained a new option, ``working_dir``
   which allows specifying the working directory for the command being
   run in the image.
-  The ec2\_win\_password module now requires the cryptography python
   module be installed to run
-  The stat module added a field, lnk\_target. When the file being
   stated is a symlink, lnk\_target will contain the target of the link.
   This differs from lnk\_source when the target is specified relative
   to the symlink. In this case, lnk\_target will remain relative while
   lnk\_source will be expanded to an absolute path.
-  The archive module has a new parameter exclude\_path which lists
   paths to exclude from the archive
-  The yum module has a new parameter security which limits state=latest
   to security updates
-  The template module gained a follow parameter to match with copy and
   file. Like those modules, template defaults this parameter to False.
   Previously, template hardcoded this to true.
-  Added a new parameter to command module that lets users specify data
   to pipe into the command's stdin.
-  The azure\_rm modules now accept a ``cloud_environment`` arg to
   access regional and private clouds.
-  The azure\_rm modules and inventory script now require at least
   version 2.0.0 of the Azure Python SDK.

2.3 "Ramble On" - 2017-04-12
----------------------------

Moving to Ansible 2.3 guide
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/porting\_guide\_2.3.html

Major Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Documented and renamed the previously released 'single var vaulting'
   feature, allowing user to use vault encryption for single variables
   in a normal YAML vars file.
-  Allow module\_utils for custom modules to be placed in site-specific
   directories and shipped in roles
-  On platforms that support it, use more modern system polling API
   instead of select in the ssh connection plugin. This removes one
   limitation on how many parallel forks are feasible on these systems.
-  Windows/WinRM supports (experimental) become method "runas" to run
   modules and scripts as a different user, and to transparently access
   network resources.
-  The WinRM connection plugin now uses pipelining when executing
   modules, resulting in significantly faster execution for small tasks.
-  The WinRM connection plugin can now manage Kerberos tickets
   automatically when ``ansible_winrm_transport=kerberos`` and
   ``ansible_user``/``ansible_password`` are specified.
-  Refactored/standardized most Windows modules, adding check-mode and
   diff support where possible.
-  Extended Windows module API with parameter-type support, helper
   functions. (i.e. Expand-Environment, Add-Warning,
   Add-DeprecatationWarning)
-  restructured how async works to allow it to apply to action plugins
   that choose to support it.

Minor Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The version and release facts for OpenBSD hosts were reversed. This
   has been changed so that version has the numeric portion and release
   has the name of the release.
-  removed 'package' from default squash actions as not all package
   managers support it and it creates errors when using loops, any user
   can add back via config options if they don't use those package
   managers or otherwise avoid the errors.
-  Blocks can now have a ``name`` field, to aid in playbook readability.
-  default strategy is now configurable via ansible.cfg or environment
   variable.
-  Added 'ansible\_playbook\_python' which contains 'current python
   executable', it can be blank in some cases in which Ansible is not
   invoked via the standard CLI (sys.executable limitation).
-  Added 'metadata' to modules to enable classification
-  ansible-doc now displays path to module and existing 'metadata'
-  added optional 'piped' transfer method to ssh plugin for when scp and
   sftp are missing, ssh plugin is also now 'smarter' when using these
   options
-  default controlpersist path is now a custom hash of host-port-user to
   avoid the socket path length errors for long hostnames
-  Various fixes for Python3 compatibility
-  Fixed issues with inventory formats not handling 'all' and
   'ungrouped' in an uniform way.
-  'service' tasks can now use async again, we had lost this capability
   when changed into an action plugin.
-  made any\_errors\_fatal inheritable from play to task and all other
   objects in between.
-  many small performance improvements in inventory and variable
   handling and in task execution.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Specifying --tags (or --skip-tags) multiple times on the command line
   currently leads to the last one overriding all the previous ones.
   This behaviour is deprecated. In the future, if you specify --tags
   multiple times the tags will be merged together. From now on, using
   --tags multiple times on one command line will emit a deprecation
   warning. Setting the merge\_multiple\_cli\_tags option to True in the
   ansible.cfg file will enable the new behaviour. In 2.4, the default
   will be to merge and you can enable the old overwriting behaviour via
   the config option. In 2.5, multiple --tags options will be merged
   with no way to go back to the old behaviour.

-  Modules (scheduled for removal in 2.5)
-  ec2\_vpc
-  cl\_bond
-  cl\_bridge
-  cl\_img\_install
-  cl\_interface
-  cl\_interface\_policy
-  cl\_license
-  cl\_ports
-  nxos\_mtu, use nxos\_system instead

New: Callbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  dense: minimal stdout output with fallback to default when verbose

New: lookups
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  keyring: allows getting password from the 'controller' system's
   keyrings
-  chef\_databag: allows querying Chef Databags via pychef library

New: cache
^^^^^^^^^^

-  pickle (uses python's own serializer)
-  yaml

New: inventory scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  oVirt/RHV

New: filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  combinations
-  permutations
-  zip
-  zip\_longest

Module Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  AWS lambda: previously ignored changes that only affected one
   parameter. Existing deployments may have outstanding changes that
   this bugfix will apply.
-  oVirt/RHV: Added support for 4.1 features and the following:
-  data centers, clusters, hosts, storage domains and networks
   management.
-  hosts and virtual machines affinity groups and labels.
-  users, groups and permissions management.
-  Improved virtual machines and disks management.
-  Mount: Some fixes so bind mounts are not mounted each time the
   playbook runs.

2.2.1 "The Battle of Evermore" - 2017-01-16
-------------------------------------------

Major Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Security fix for CVE-2016-9587 - An attacker with control over a
   client system being managed by Ansible and the ability to send facts
   back to the Ansible server could use this flaw to execute arbitrary
   code on the Ansible server as the user and group Ansible is running
   as.

Minor Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fixes a bug where undefined variables in with\_\* loops would cause a
   task failure even if the when condition would cause the task to be
   skipped.
-  Fixed a bug related to roles where in certain situations a role may
   be run more than once despite not allowing duplicates.
-  Fixed some additional bugs related to atomic\_move for modules.
-  Fixes multiple bugs related to field/attribute inheritance in nested
   blocks and includes, as well as task iteration logic during failures.
-  Fixed pip installing packages into virtualenvs using the system pip
   instead of the virtualenv pip.
-  Fixed dnf on systems with dnf-2.0.x (some changes in the API).
-  Fixed traceback with dnf install of groups.
-  Fixes a bug in which include\_vars was not working with failed\_when.
-  Fix for include\_vars only loading files with .yml, .yaml, and .json
   extensions. This was only supposed to apply to loading a directory of
   vars files.
-  Fixes several bugs related to properly incrementing the failed count
   in the host statistics.
-  Fixes a bug with listening handlers which did not specify a ``name``
   field.
-  Fixes a bug with the ``play_hosts`` internal variable, so that it
   properly reflects the current list of hosts.
-  Fixes a bug related to the v2\_playbook\_on\_start callback method
   and legacy (v1) plugins.
-  Fixes an openssh related process exit race condition, related to the
   fact that connections using ControlPersist do not close stderr.
-  Improvements and fixes to OpenBSD fact gathering.
-  Updated ``make deb`` to use pbuilder. Use ``make local_deb`` for the
   previous non-pbuilder build.
-  Fixed Windows async to avoid blocking due to handle inheritance.
-  Fixed bugs in the mount module on older Linux kernels and BSDs
-  Various minor fixes for Python 3
-  Inserted some checks for jinja2-2.9, which can cause some issues with
   Ansible currently.

2.2 "The Battle of Evermore" - 2016-11-01
-----------------------------------------

Major Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Added the ``listen`` feature for modules. This feature allows tasks
   to more easily notify multiple handlers, as well as making it easier
   for handlers from decoupled roles to be notified.
-  Major performance improvements.
-  Added support for binary modules
-  Added the ability to specify serial batches as a list
   (``serial: [1, 5, 10]``), which allows for so-called "canary" actions
   in one play.
-  Fixed 'local type' plugins and actions to have a more predictable
   relative path. Fixes a regression of 1.9 (PR #16805). Existing users
   of 2.x will need to adjust related tasks.
-  ``meta`` tasks can now use conditionals.
-  ``raw`` now returns ``changed: true`` to be consistent with
   shell/command/script modules. Add ``changed_when: false`` to ``raw``
   tasks to restore the pre-2.2 behavior if necessary.
-  New privilege escalation become method ``ksu``
-  Windows ``async:`` support for long-running or background tasks.
-  Windows ``environment:`` support for setting module environment vars
   in play/task.
-  Added a new ``meta`` option: ``end_play``, which can be used to skip
   to the end of a play.
-  roles can now be included in the middle of a task list via the new
   ``include_role`` module, this also allows for making the role import
   'loopable' and/or conditional.
-  The service module has been changed to use system specific modules if
   they exist and fall back to the old service module if they cannot be
   found or detected.
-  Add ability to specify what ssh client binary to use on the
   controller. This can be configured via ssh\_executable in the ansible
   config file or by setting ansible\_ssh\_executable as an inventory
   variable if different ones are needed for different hosts.
-  Windows:
-  several facts were modified or renamed for consistency with their
   Unix counterparts, and many new facts were added. If your playbooks
   rely on any of the following keys, please ensure they are using the
   correct key names and/or values:

   -  ansible\_date\_time.date (changed to use yyyy-mm-dd format instead
      of default system-locale format)
   -  ansible\_date\_time.iso8601 (changed to UTC instead of local time)
   -  ansible\_distribution (now uses OS caption string, e.g.:
      "Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard", version is still
      available on ansible\_distribution\_version)
   -  ansible\_totalmem (renamed to ansible\_memtotal\_mb, units changed
      to MB instead of bytes)

-  ``async:`` support for long-running or background tasks.
-  ``environment:`` support for setting module environment vars in
   play/task.
-  Tech Preview: Work has been done to get Ansible running under
   Python3. This work is not complete enough to depend upon in
   production environments but it is enough to begin testing it.
-  Most of the controller side should now work. Users should be able to
   run python3 /usr/bin/ansible and python3 /usr/bin/ansible-playbook
   and have core features of ansible work.
-  A few of the most essential modules have been audited and are known
   to work. Others work out of the box.
-  We are using unit and integration tests to help us port code and not
   regress later. Even if you are not familiar with python you can still
   help by contributing integration tests (just ansible roles) that
   exercise more of the code to make sure it continues to run on both
   Python2 and Python3.
-  scp\_if\_ssh now supports True, False and "smart". "smart" is the
   default and will retry failed sftp transfers with scp.
-  Network:
-  Refactored all network modules to remove duplicate code and take
   advantage of Ansiballz implementation
-  All functionality from \*\_template network modules have been
   combined into \*\_config module
-  Network \*\_command modules not longer allow configuration mode
   statements

New Callbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  foreman

Minor Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  now -vvv shows exact path from which 'currently executing module' was
   picked up from.
-  loop\_control now has a label option to allow fine grained control
   what gets displayed per item
-  loop\_control now has a pause option to allow pausing for N seconds
   between loop iterations of a task.
-  New privilege escalation become method ``ksu``
-  ``raw`` now returns ``changed: true`` to be consistent with
   shell/command/script modules. Add ``changed_when: false`` to ``raw``
   tasks to restore the pre-2.2 behavior if necessary.
-  removed previously deprecated ';' as host list separator.
-  Only check if the default ssh client supports ControlPersist once
   instead of once for each host + task combination.
-  Fix a problem with the pip module updating the python pip package
   itself.
-  ansible\_play\_hosts is a new magic variable to provide a list of
   hosts in scope for the current play. Unlike play\_hosts it is not
   subject to the 'serial' keyword.
-  ansible\_play\_batch is a new magic variable meant to substitute the
   current play\_hosts.

For custom front ends using the API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ansible.parsing.vault:
-  VaultLib.is\_encrypted() has been deprecated. It will be removed in
   2.4. Use ansible.parsing.vault.is\_encrypted() instead
-  VaultFile has been removed. This unfinished code was never used
   inside of Ansible. The feature it was intended to support has now
   been implemented without using this.
-  VaultAES, the older, insecure encrypted format that debuted in
   Ansible-1.5 and was replaced by VaultAES256 less than a week later,
   now has a deprecation warning. **It will be removed in 2.3**. In the
   unlikely event that you wrote a vault file in that 1 week window and
   have never modified the file since (ansible-vault automatically
   re-encrypts the file using VaultAES256 whenever it is written to but
   not read), run ``ansible-vault rekey [filename]`` to move to
   VaultAES256.

Removed Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ';' as host list separator.
-  with\_ 'bare variable' handling, now loop items must always be
   templated ``{{ }}`` or they will be considered as plain strings.
-  skipping task on 'missing attribute' in loop variable, now in a loop
   an undefined attribute will return an error instead of skipping the
   task.
-  skipping on undefined variables in loop, now loops will have to
   define a variable or use ``|default`` to avoid errors.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notice given that the following will be removed in Ansible 2.4: \*
Modules \* eos\_template \* ios\_template \* iosxr\_template \*
junos\_template \* nxos\_template \* ops\_template

2.1.4 "The Song Remains the Same" - 2017-01-16
----------------------------------------------

-  Security fix for CVE-2016-9587 - An attacker with control over a
   client system being managed by Ansible and the ability to send facts
   back to the Ansible server could use this flaw to execute arbitrary
   code on the Ansible server as the user and group Ansible is running
   as.
-  Fixed a bug with conditionals in loops, where undefined variables and
   other errors will defer raising the error until the conditional has
   been evaluated.
-  Added a version check for jinja2-2.9, which does not fully work with
   Ansible currently.

2.1.3 "The Song Remains the Same" - 2016-11-04
----------------------------------------------

-  Security fix for CVE-2016-8628 - Command injection by compromised
   server via fact variables. In some situations, facts returned by
   modules could overwrite connection-based facts or some other special
   variables, leading to injected commands running on the Ansible
   controller as the user running Ansible (or via escalated
   permissions).
-  Security fix for CVE-2016-8614 - apt\_key module not properly
   validating keys in some situations.

Minor Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The subversion module from core now marks its password parameter as
   no\_log so the password is obscured when logging.
-  The postgresql\_lang and postgresql\_ext modules from extras now mark
   login\_password as no\_log so the password is obscured when logging.
-  Fixed several bugs related to locating files relative to
   role/playbook directories.
-  Fixed a bug in the way hosts were tested for failed states, resulting
   in incorrectly skipped block sessions.
-  Fixed a bug in the way our custom JSON encoder is used for the
   ``to_json*`` filters.
-  Fixed some bugs related to the use of non-ascii characters in become
   passwords.
-  Fixed a bug with Azure modules which may be using the latest rc6
   library.
-  Backported some docker\_common fixes.

2.1.2 "The Song Remains the Same" - 2016-09-29
----------------------------------------------

Minor Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fixed a bug related to creation of retry files (#17456)
-  Fixed a bug in the way include params are used when an include task
   is dynamic (#17064)
-  Fixed a bug related to including blocks in an include task (#15963)
-  Fixed a bug related to the use of hostvars internally when creating
   the connection plugin. This prevents things like variables using
   lookups from being evaluated unnecessarily (#17024)
-  Fixed a bug where using a variable containing a list for the
   ``hosts`` of a play resulted in an list of lists (#16583)
-  Fixed a bug where integer values would cause an error if a module
   param was of type ``float`` (no issue)
-  Fixed a bug with net\_template failing if src was not specified
   (#17726)
-  Fixed a bug in "ansible-galaxy import" (#17417)
-  Fixed a bug in which INI files incorrectly treated a hosts range as a
   section header (#15331)
-  Fixed a bug in which the max\_fail\_percentage calculation
   erroneously caused a series of plays to stop executing (#15954)
-  Fixed a bug in which the task names were not properly templated
   (#16295)
-  Fixed a bug causing "squashed" loops (ie. yum, apt) to incorrectly
   report results (ansible-modules-core#4214)
-  Fixed several bugs related to includes:
-  when including statically, make sure that all parents were also
   included statically (issue #16990)
-  properly resolve nested static include paths
-  print a message when a file is statically included
-  Fixed a bug in which module params expected to be float types were
   not converted from integers (only strings) (#17325)
-  Fixed a bug introduced by static includes in 2.1, which prevented
   notifications from going to the "top level" handler name.
-  Fixed a bug where a group\_vars or host\_vars directory in the
   current working directory would be used (and would take precedence)
   over those in the inventory and/or playbook directory.
-  Fixed a bug which could occur when the result of an async task did
   not parse as valid JSON.
-  (re)-allowed the use of ansible\_python\_interpreter lines with more
   than one argument.
-  Fixed several bugs related to the creation of the implicit localhost
   in inventory.
-  Fixed a bug related to an unspecified number of retries when using
   until.
-  Fixed a race-condition bug when creating temp directories before the
   worker process is forked.
-  Fix a bug with async's poll keyword not making use of
   ansible\_python\_interpreter to run (and thus breaking when
   /usr/bin/python is not present on the remote machine.)
-  Fix a bug where hosts that started with a range in inventory were
   being treated as an invalid section header.

Module fixes: \* Fixed a bug where the temporary CA files created by the
module helper code were not being deleted properly in some situations
(#17073) \* Fixed many bugs in the unarchive module \* Fixes for module
ec2: - Fixed a bug related to source\_dest\_check when used with non-vpc
instances (core#3243) - Fixed a bug in ec2 where instances were not
powering of when referenced via tags only (core#4765) - Fixed a bug
where instances with multiple interfaces were not powering up/down
correctly (core#3234) \* Fixes for module get\_url: - Fixed a bug in
get\_url module to force a download if there is a checksum mismatch
regardless of the last modified time (core#4262) - Fixed a bug in
get\_url module to properly process FTP results (core#3661 and
core#4601) \* Fixed a bug in win\_user related to users with disabled
accounts/expired passwords (core#4369) \* ini\_file: - Fixed a bug where
option lines are now inserted before blank lines. - Fixed a bug where
leading whitespace prevented matches on options. \* Fixed a bug in
iam\_cert when dup\_ok is used as a string. \* Fixed a bug in
postgresql\_db related to the changed logic when state=absent. \* Fixed
a bug where single\_transaction and quick were not passed into db\_dump
for the mysql\_db module. \* Fixed a bug where the fetch module was not
idempotent when retrieving the target of a symlink. \* Many minor fixes
for bugs in extras modules.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Deprecated the use of ``_fixup_perms``. Use ``_fixup_perms2``
   instead. This change only impacts custom action plugins using
   ``_fixup_perms``.

Incompatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Use of ``_fixup_perms`` with ``recursive=True`` (the default) is no
   longer supported. Custom action plugins using ``_fixup_perms`` will
   require changes unless they already use ``recursive=False``. Use
   ``_fixup_perms2`` if support for previous releases is not required.
   Otherwise use ``_fixup_perms`` with ``recursive=False``.

2.1 "The Song Remains the Same"
-------------------------------

Major Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Official support for the networking modules, originally available in
   2.0 as a tech preview.
-  Refactored and expanded support for Docker with new modules and many
   improvements to existing modules, as well as a new Kubernetes module.
-  Added new modules for Azure (see below for the full list)
-  Added the ability to specify includes as "static" (either through a
   configuration option or on a per-include basis). When includes are
   static, they are loaded at compile time and cannot contain dynamic
   features like loops.
-  Added a new strategy ``debug``, which allows per-task debugging of
   playbooks, for more details see
   https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks\_debugger.html
-  Added a new option for tasks: ``loop_control``. This currently only
   supports one option - ``loop_var``, which allows a different loop
   variable from ``item`` to be used.
-  Added the ability to filter facts returned by the fact gathering
   setup step using the ``gather_subset`` option on the play or in the
   ansible.cfg configuration file. See
   http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro\_configuration.html#gathering
   for details on the format of the option.
-  Added the ability to send per-item callbacks, rather than a batch
   update (this more closely resembles the behavior of Ansible 1.x).
-  Added facility for modules to send back 'diff' for display when
   ansible is called with --diff, updated several modules to return this
   info
-  Added ansible-console tool, a REPL shell that allows running adhoc
   tasks against a chosen inventory (based on
   https://github.com/dominis/ansible-shell)
-  Added two new variables, which are set when the ``rescue`` portion of
   a ``block`` is started:
-  ``ansible_failed_task``, which contains the serialized version of the
   failed task.
-  ``ansible_failed_result``, which contains the result of the failed
   task.
-  New meta action, ``meta: clear_host_errors`` which will clear any
   hosts which were marked as failed (but not unreachable hosts).
-  New meta action, ``meta: clear_facts`` which will remove existing
   facts for the current host from current memory and facts cache.
-  copy module can now transparently use a vaulted file as source, if
   vault passwords were provided it will decrypt and copy on the fly.
-  The way new-style python modules (which include all of the
   non-windows modules shipped with Ansible) are assembled before
   execution on the remote machine has been changed. The new way stays
   closer to how python imports modules which will make it easier to
   write modules which rely heavily on shared code.
-  Reduce the situations in which a module can end up as world readable.
   For details, see:
   https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/become.html#becoming-an-unprivileged-user
-  Re-implemented the retry file feature, which had been left out of 2.0
   (fix was backported to 2.0.1 originally).
-  Improved winrm argument validation and feature sniffing (for upcoming
   pywinrm NTLM support).
-  Improved winrm error handling: basic parsing of stderr from CLIXML
   stream.

Minor Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Added support for pipelining mode to more connection plugins, which
   helps prevent module data from being written to disk.
-  Added a new '!unsafe' YAML decorator, which can be used in playbooks
   to ensure a string is not templated. For example:
   ``foo: !unsafe "Don't template {{me}}"``.
-  Callbacks now have access to the options with which the CLI was
   called
-  Debug now has verbosity option to control when to display by matching
   number of -v in command line
-  Modules now get verbosity, diff and other flags as passed to ansible
-  Mount facts now also show 'network mounts' that use the pattern
   ``<host>:/<mount>``
-  Plugins are now sorted before loading. This means, for instance, if
   you want two custom callback plugins to run in a certain order you
   can name them 10-first-callback.py and 20-second-callback.py.
-  Added (alpha) Centirfy's dzdo as another become meethod (privilege
   escalation)

Deprecations:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Deprecated the use of "bare" variables in loops (ie.
   ``with_items: foo``, where ``foo`` is a variable). The full jinja2
   variable syntax of ``{{foo}}`` should always be used instead. This
   warning will be removed completely in 2.3, after which time it will
   be an error.
-  play\_hosts magic variable, use ansible\_play\_batch or
   ansible\_play\_hosts instead.

2.0.2 "Over the Hills and Far Away"
-----------------------------------

-  Backport of the 2.1 feature to ensure per-item callbacks are sent as
   they occur, rather than all at once at the end of the task.
-  Fixed bugs related to the iteration of tasks when certain
   combinations of roles, blocks, and includes were used, especially
   when handling errors in rescue/always portions of blocks.
-  Fixed handling of redirects in our helper code, and ported the uri
   module to use this helper code. This removes the httplib dependency
   for this module while fixing some bugs related to redirects and SSL
   certs.
-  Fixed some bugs related to the incorrect creation of extra temp
   directories for uploading files, which were not cleaned up properly.
-  Improved error reporting in certain situations, to provide more
   information such as the playbook file/line.
-  Fixed a bug related to the variable precedence of role parameters,
   especially when a role may be used both as a dependency of a role and
   directly by itself within the same play.
-  Fixed some bugs in the 2.0 implementation of do/until.
-  Fixed some bugs related to run\_once:
-  Ensure that all hosts are marked as failed if a task marked as
   run\_once fails.
-  Show a warning when using the free strategy when a run\_once task is
   encountered, as there is no way for the free strategy to guarantee
   the task is not run more than once.
-  Fixed a bug where the assemble module was not honoring check mode in
   some situations.
-  Fixed a bug related to delegate\_to, where we were incorrectly using
   variables from the inventory host rather than the delegated-to host.
-  The 'package' meta-module now properly squashes items down to a
   single execution (as the apt/yum/other package modules do).
-  Fixed a bug related to the ansible-galaxy CLI command dealing with
   paged results from the Galaxy server.
-  Pipelining support is now available for the local and jail connection
   plugins, which is useful for users who do not wish to have temp
   files/directories created when running tasks with these connection
   types.
-  Improvements in support for additional shell types.
-  Improvements in the code which is used to calculate checksums for
   remote files.
-  Some speed ups and bug fixes related to the variable merging code.
-  Workaround bug in python subprocess on El Capitan that was making
   vault fail when attempting to encrypt a file
-  Fix lxc\_container module having predictable temp file names and
   setting file permissions on the temporary file too leniently on a
   temporary file that was executed as a script. Addresses CVE-2016-3096
-  Fix a bug in the uri module where setting headers via module params
   that start with ``HEADER_`` were causing a traceback.
-  Fix bug in the free strategy that was causing it to synchronize its
   workers after every task (making it a lot more like linear than it
   should have been).

2.0.1 "Over the Hills and Far Away"
-----------------------------------

-  Fixes a major compatibility break in the synchronize module shipped
   with 2.0.0.x. That version of synchronize ran sudo on the controller
   prior to running rsync. In 1.9.x and previous, sudo was run on the
   host that rsync connected to. 2.0.1 restores the 1.9.x behaviour.
-  Additionally, several other problems with where synchronize chose to
   run when combined with delegate\_to were fixed. In particular, if a
   playbook targetted localhost and then delegated\_to a remote host the
   prior behavior (in 1.9.x and 2.0.0.x) was to copy files between the
   src and destination directories on the delegated host. This has now
   been fixed to copy between localhost and the delegated host.
-  Fix a regression where synchronize was unable to deal with unicode
   paths.
-  Fix a regression where synchronize deals with inventory hosts that
   use localhost but with an alternate port.
-  Fixes a regression where the retry files feature was not implemented.
-  Fixes a regression where the any\_errors\_fatal option was
   implemented in 2.0 incorrectly, and also adds a feature where
   any\_errors\_fatal can be set at the block level.
-  Fix tracebacks when playbooks or ansible itself were located in
   directories with unicode characters.
-  Fix bug when sending unicode characters to an external pager for
   display.
-  Fix a bug with squashing loops for special modules (mostly package
   managers). The optimization was squashing when the loop did not apply
   to the selection of packages. This has now been fixed.
-  Temp files created when using vault are now "shredded" using the unix
   shred program which overwrites the file with random data.
-  Some fixes to cloudstack modules for case sensitivity
-  Fix non-newstyle modules (non-python modules and old-style modules)
   to disabled pipelining.
-  Fix fetch module failing even if fail\_on\_missing is set to False
-  Fix for cornercase when local connections, sudo, and raw were used
   together.
-  Fix dnf module to remove dependent packages when state=absent is
   specified. This was a feature of the 1.9.x version that was left out
   by mistake when the module was rewritten for 2.0.
-  Fix bugs with non-english locales in yum, git, and apt modules
-  Fix a bug with the dnf module where state=latest could only upgrade,
   not install.
-  Fix to make implicit fact gathering task correctly inherit settings
   from play, this might cause an error if settings environment on play
   depending on 'ansible\_env' which was previouslly ignored

2.0 "Over the Hills and Far Away" - Jan 12, 2016
------------------------------------------------

Major Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Releases are now named after Led Zeppelin songs, 1.9 will be the last
   Van Halen named release.
-  The new block/rescue/always directives allow for making task blocks
   and exception-like semantics
-  New strategy plugins (e.g. ``free``) allow control over the flow of
   task execution per play. The default (``linear``) will be the same as
   before.
-  Improved error handling, with more detailed parser messages. General
   exception handling and display has been revamped.
-  Task includes are now evaluated during execution, allowing more
   dynamic includes and options. Play includes are unchanged both still
   use the ``include`` directive.
-  "with\_" loops can now be used with task includes since they are
   dynamic.
-  Callback, connection, cache and lookup plugin APIs have changed.
   Existing plugins might require modification to work with the new
   versions.
-  Callbacks are now shipped in the active directory and don't need to
   be copied, just whitelisted in ansible.cfg.
-  Many API changes. Those integrating directly with Ansible's API will
   encounter breaking changes, but the new API is much easier to use and
   test.
-  Settings are now more inheritable; what you set at play, block or
   role will be automatically inherited by the contained tasks. This
   allows for new features to automatically be settable at all levels,
   previously we had to manually code this.
-  Vars are now settable at play, block, role and task level with the
   ``vars`` directive and scoped to the tasks contained.
-  Template code now retains types for bools and numbers instead of
   turning them into strings. If you need the old behaviour, quote the
   value and it will get passed around as a string
-  Empty variables and variables set to null in yaml will no longer be
   converted to empty strings. They will retain the value of ``None``.
   To go back to the old behaviour, you can override the
   ``null_representation`` setting to an empty string in your config
   file or by setting the ``ANSIBLE_NULL_REPRESENTATION`` environment
   variable.
-  Added ``meta: refresh_inventory`` to force rereading the inventory in
   a play. This re-executes inventory scripts, but does not force them
   to ignore any cache they might use.
-  New delegate\_facts directive, a boolean that allows you to apply
   facts to the delegated host (true/yes) instead of the
   inventory\_hostname (no/false) which is the default and previous
   behaviour.
-  local connections now work with 'su' as a privilege escalation method
-  Ansible 2.0 has deprecated the “ssh” from ansible\_ssh\_user,
   ansible\_ssh\_host, and ansible\_ssh\_port to become ansible\_user,
   ansible\_host, and ansible\_port.
-  New ssh configuration variables (``ansible_ssh_common_args``,
   ``ansible_ssh_extra_args``) can be used to configure a per-group or
   per-host ssh ProxyCommand or set any other ssh options.
   ``ansible_ssh_extra_args`` is used to set options that are accepted
   only by ssh (not sftp or scp, which have their own analogous
   settings).
-  ansible-pull can now verify the code it runs when using git as a
   source repository, using git's code signing and verification
   features.
-  Backslashes used when specifying parameters in jinja2 expressions in
   YAML dicts sometimes needed to be escaped twice. This has been fixed
   so that escaping once works. Here's an example of how playbooks need
   to be modified:

   .. code:: yaml

       # Syntax in 1.9.x
       - debug:
           msg: "{{ 'test1_junk 1\\\\3' | regex_replace('(.*)_junk (.*)', '\\\\1 \\\\2') }}"
       # Syntax in 2.0.x
       - debug:
           msg: "{{ 'test1_junk 1\\3' | regex_replace('(.*)_junk (.*)', '\\1 \\2') }}"

       # Output:
       "msg": "test1 1\\3"

-  When a string with a trailing newline was specified in the playbook
   via yaml dict format, the trailing newline was stripped. When
   specified in key=value format the trailing newlines were kept. In v2,
   both methods of specifying the string will keep the trailing
   newlines. If you relied on the trailing newline being stripped you
   can change your playbook like this:

   .. code:: yaml

       # Syntax in 1.9.2
       vars:
         message: >
           Testing
           some things
       tasks:
       - debug:
           msg: "{{ message }}"

       # Syntax in 2.0.x
       vars:
         old_message: >
           Testing
           some things
         message: "{{ old_messsage[:-1] }}"
       - debug:
           msg: "{{ message }}"
       # Output
       "msg": "Testing some things"

-  When specifying complex args as a variable, the variable must use the
   full jinja2 variable syntax ('{{var\_name}}') - bare variable names
   there are no longer accepted. In fact, even specifying args with
   variables has been deprecated, and will not be allowed in future
   versions:

   .. code:: yaml

       ---
       - hosts: localhost
         connection: local
         gather_facts: false
         vars:
           my_dirs:
             - { path: /tmp/3a, state: directory, mode: 0755 }
             - { path: /tmp/3b, state: directory, mode: 0700 }
         tasks:
           - file:
             args: "{{item}}"
             with_items: my_dirs

Plugins
~~~~~~~

-  Rewritten dnf module that should be faster and less prone to
   encountering bugs in cornercases
-  WinRM connection plugin passes all vars named ``ansible_winrm_*`` to
   the underlying pywinrm client. This allows, for instance,
   ``ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore`` to be used with newer
   versions of pywinrm to disable certificate validation on Python
   2.7.9+.
-  WinRM connection plugin put\_file is significantly faster and no
   longer has file size limitations.

Minor changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Many more tests. The new API makes things more testable and we took
   advantage of it.
-  big\_ip modules now support turning off ssl certificate validation
   (use only for self-signed certificates).
-  Consolidated code from modules using urllib2 to normalize features,
   TLS and SNI support.
-  synchronize module's dest\_port parameter now takes precedence over
   the ansible\_ssh\_port inventory setting.
-  Play output is now dynamically sized to terminal with a minimum of 80
   coluumns (old default).
-  vars\_prompt and pause are now skipped with a warning if the play is
   called noninteractively (i.e. pull from cron).
-  Support for OpenBSD's 'doas' privilege escalation method.
-  Most vault operations can now be done over multilple files.
-  ansible-vault encrypt/decrypt read from stdin if no other input file
   is given, and can write to a given ``--output file`` (including
   stdout, '-'). This lets you avoid ever writing sensitive plaintext to
   disk.
-  ansible-vault rekey accepts the --new-vault-password-file option.
-  ansible-vault now preserves file permissions on edit and rekey and
   defaults to restrictive permissions for other options.
-  Configuration items defined as paths (local only) now all support
   shell style interpolations.
-  Many fixes and new options added to modules, too many to list here.
-  Now you can see task file and line number when using verbosity of 3
   or above.
-  The ``[x-y]`` host range syntax is no longer supported. Note that
   ``[0:1]`` matches two hosts, i.e. the range is inclusive of its
   endpoints.
-  We now recommend the use of ``pattern1,pattern2`` to combine host
   matching patterns.
-  The use of ':' as a separator conflicts with IPv6 addresses and host
   ranges. It will be deprecated in the future.
-  The undocumented use of ';' as a separator is now deprecated.
-  modules and callbacks have been extended to support no\_log to avoid
   data disclosure.
-  new managed\_syslog option has been added to control output to syslog
   on managed machines, no\_log supersedes this settings.
-  Lookup, vars and action plugin pathing has been normalized, all now
   follow the same sequence to find relative files.
-  We do not ignore the explicitly set login user for ssh when it
   matches the 'current user' anymore, this allows overriding
   .ssh/config when it is set explicitly. Leaving it unset will still
   use the same user and respect .ssh/config. This also means
   ansible\_ssh\_user can now return a None value.
-  environment variables passed to remote shells now default to
   'controller' settings, with fallback to en\_US.UTF8 which was the
   previous default.
-  add\_hosts is much stricter about host name and will prevent invalid
   names from being added.
-  ansible-pull now defaults to doing shallow checkouts with git, use
   ``--full`` to return to previous behaviour.
-  random cows are more random
-  when: now gets the registered var after the first iteration, making
   it possible to break out of item loops
-  Handling of undefined variables has changed. In most places they will
   now raise an error instead of silently injecting an empty string. Use
   the default filter if you want to approximate the old behaviour:

   ::

       - debug: msg="The error message was: {{error_code |default('') }}"

1.9.7 "Dancing in the Street" - TBD

   were not found when placed inside of an inventory directory.
-  Fix lxc\_container having predictable temp file names. Addresses
   CVE-2016-3096

1.9.5 "Dancing In the Street" - Mar 21, 2016
--------------------------------------------

   suffix checking was not ordered
-  Fix bug in the literal\_eval module code used when we need python-2.4
   compat
-  Added --ignore-certs, -c option to ansible-galaxy. Allows
   ansible-galaxy to work behind a proxy when the proxy fails to forward
   server certificates.
-  Fixed bug where tasks marked no\_log were showing hidden values in
   output if ansible's --diff option was used.
-  Fix bug with non-english locales in git and apt modules
-  Compatibility fix for using state=absent with the pip ansible module
   and pip-6.1.0+

   group membership removals, various checkmode fixes).

1.9.4 "Dancing In the Street" - Oct 9, 2015
-------------------------------------------

-  Fixes a bug where yum state=latest would error if there were no
   updates to install.
-  Fixes a bug where yum state=latest did not work with wildcard package

-------------------------------------------

-  Fixes a bug related to keyczar messing up encodings internally,
   resulting in decrypted messages coming out as empty strings.
-  AES Keys generated for use in accelerated mode are now 256-bit by
   default instead of 128.
-  Fix url fetching for SNI with python-2.7.9 or greater. SNI does not
   work with python < 2.7.9. The best workaround is probably to use the
   command module with curl or wget.
-  Fix url fetching to allow tls-1.1 and tls-1.2 if the system's openssl
   library supports those protocols
-  Fix ec2\_ami\_search module to check TLS Certificates

   were non-printable ASCII characters contained within it

1.9.2 "Dancing In the Street" - Jun 26, 2015
--------------------------------------------

-  Security fixes to check that hostnames match certificates with https
   urls (CVE-2015-3908)
-  get\_url and uri modules
-  url and etcd lookup plugins
-  Security fixes to the zone (Solaris containers), jail (bsd
   containers), and chroot connection plugins. These plugins can be used
   to connect to their respective container types in leiu of the
   standard ssh connection. Prior to this fix being applied these
   connection plugins didn't properly handle symlinks within the
   containers which could lead to files intended to be written to or
   read from the container being written to or read from the host system
   instead. (CVE pending)
-  Fixed a bug in the service module where init scripts were being
   incorrectly used instead of upstart/systemd.

   parameter.
-  Fixed a traceback in the gce module on EL6 distros when multiple
   pycrypto installations are available.
-  Added support for PostgreSQL 9.4 in rds\_param\_group

1.9 "Dancing In the Street" - Mar 25, 2015
------------------------------------------

Major changes:

-  Added kerberos support to winrm connection plugin.
-  Tags rehaul: added 'all', 'always', 'untagged' and 'tagged' special
   tags and normalized tag resolution. Added tag information to
   --list-tasks and new --list-tags option.
-  Privilege Escalation generalization, new 'Become' system and
   variables now will handle existing and new methods. Sudo and su have
   been kept for backwards compatibility. New methods pbrun and pfexec
   in 'alpha' state, planned adding 'runas' for winrm connection plugin.
-  Improved ssh connection error reporting, now you get back the
   specific message from ssh.
-  Added facility to document task module return values for registered
   vars, both for ansible-doc and the docsite. Documented copy, stats
   and acl modules, the rest must be updated individually (we will start
   doing so incrementally).
-  Optimize the plugin loader to cache available plugins much more
   efficiently. For some use cases this can lead to dramatic
   improvements in startup time.
-  Overhaul of the checksum system, now supports more systems and more
   cases more reliably and uniformly.
-  Fix skipped tasks to not display their parameters if no\_log is
   specified.
-  Many fixes to unicode support, standarized functions to make it
   easier to add to input/output boundaries.
-  Added travis integration to github for basic tests, this should speed
   up ticket triage and merging.
-  environment: directive now can also be applied to play and is
   inhertited by tasks, which can still override it.
-  expanded facts and OS/distribution support for existing facts and
   improved performance with pypy.
-  new 'wantlist' option to lookups allows for selecting a list typed
   variable vs a comma delimited string as the return.
-  the shared module code for file backups now uses a timestamp
   resolution of seconds (previouslly minutes).
-  allow for empty inventories, this is now a warning and not an error
   (for those using localhost and cloud modules).
-  sped up YAML parsing in ansible by up to 25% by switching to CParser
   loader.

New Modules:

-  cryptab *-- manages linux encrypted block devices*
-  gce\_img *-- for utilizing GCE image resources*
-  gluster\_volume *-- manage glusterfs volumes*
-  haproxy *-- for the load balancer of same name*
-  known\_hosts *-- manages the ssh known\_hosts file*
-  lxc\_container *-- manage lxc containers*
-  patch *-- allows for patching files on target systems*
-  pkg5 *-- installing and uninstalling packages on Solaris*
-  pkg5\_publisher *-- manages Solaris pkg5 repository configuration*
-  postgresql\_ext *-- manage postgresql extensions*
-  snmp\_facts *-- gather facts via snmp*
-  svc *-- manages daemontools based services*
-  uptimerobot *-- manage monitoring with this service*

New Filters:

-  ternary: allows for trueval/falseval assignment dependent on
   conditional
-  cartesian: returns the Cartesian product of 2 lists
-  to\_uuid: given a string it will return an ansible domain specific
   UUID
-  checksum: uses the ansible internal checksum to return a hash from a
   string
-  hash: get a hash from a string (md5, sha1, etc)
-  password\_hash: get a hash form as string that can be used as a
   password in the user module (and others)
-  A whole set of ip/network manipulation filters:
   ipaddr,ipwrap,ipv4,ipv6ipsubnet,nthhost,hwaddr,macaddr

Other Notable Changes:

-  New lookup plugins:
-  dig: does dns resolution and returns IPs.
-  url: allows pulling data from a url.

-  New callback plugins:
-  syslog\_json: allows logging play output to a syslog network server
   using json format

-  Many new enhancements to the amazon web service modules:
-  ec2 now applies all specified security groups when creating a new
   instance. Previously it was only applying one
-  ec2\_vol gained the ability to specify the EBS volume type
-  ec2\_vol can now detach volumes by specifying instance=None
-  Fix ec2\_group to purge specific grants rather than whole rules
-  Added tenancy support for the ec2 module
-  rds module has gained the ability to manage tags and set charset and
   public accessibility
-  ec2\_snapshot module gained the capability to remove snapshots
-  Add alias support for route53
-  Add private\_zones support to route53
-  ec2\_asg: Add wait\_for\_instances parameter that waits until an
   instance is ready before ending the ansible task
-  Many new docker improvements:
-  restart\_policy parameters to configure when the container
   automatically restarts
-  If the docker client or server doesn't support an option, the task
   will now fail instead of silently ignoring the option
-  Add insecure\_registry parameter for connecting to registries via
   http
-  New parameter to set a container's domain name
-  Undeprecated docker\_image module until there's replacement
   functionality
-  Allow setting the container's pid namespace
-  Add a pull parameter that chooses when ansible will look for more
   recent images in the registry
-  docker module states have been greatly enhanced. The reworked and new
   states are:

   -  present now creates but does not start containers
   -  restarted always restarts a container
   -  reloaded restarts a container if ansible detects that the
      configuration is different than what is specified
   -  reloaded accounts for exposed ports, env vars, and volumes

-  Can now connect to the docker server using TLS
-  Several source control modules had force parameters that defaulted to
   true. These have been changed to default to false so as not to
   accidentally lose work. Playbooks that depended on the former
   behaviour simply need to add force=True to the task that needs it.
   Affected modules:
-  bzr: When local modifications exist in a checkout, the bzr module
   used to default to removing the modifications on any operation. Now
   the module will not remove the modifications unless force=yes is
   specified. Operations that depend on a clean working tree may fail
   unless force=yes is added.
-  git: When local modifications exist in a checkout, the git module
   will now fail unless force is explicitly specified. Specifying
   force=yes will allow the module to revert and overwrite local
   modifications to make git actions succeed.
-  hg: When local modifications exist in a checkout, the hg module used
   to default to removing the modifications on any operation. Now the
   module will not remove the modifications unless force=yes is
   specified.
-  subversion: When updating a checkout with local modifications, you
   now need to add force=yes so the module will revert the modifications
   before updating.
-  New inventory scripts:
-  vbox: virtualbox
-  consul: use consul as an inventory source
-  gce gained the ip\_forward parameter to forward ip packets
-  disk\_auto\_delete parameter to gce that will remove the boot disk
   after an instance is destroyed
-  gce can now spawn instances with no external ip
-  gce\_pd gained the ability to choose a disk type
-  gce\_net gained target\_tags parameter for creating firewall rules
-  rax module has new parameters for making use of a boot volume
-  Add scheduler\_hints to the nova\_compute module for optional
   parameters
-  vsphere\_guest now supports deploying guests from a template
-  Many fixes for hardlink and softlink handling in file-related modules
-  Implement user, group, mode, and selinux parameters for the unarchive
   module
-  authorized\_keys can now use url as a key source
-  authorized\_keys has a new exclusive parameter that determines if
   keys that weren't specified in the task
-  The selinux module now sets the current running state to permissive
   if state='disabled'
-  Can now set accounts to expire via the user module
-  Overhaul of the service module to make code simpler and behave better
   for systems running several popular init systems
-  yum module now has a parameter to refresh its cache of package
   metadata
-  apt module gained a build\_dep parameter to install a package's build
   dependencies
-  Add parameters to the postgres modules to specify a unix socket to
   connect to the db
-  The mount module now supports bind mounts
-  Add a clone parameter to git module that allows you to get
   information about a remote repo even if it doesn't exist locally.
-  Add a refspec argument to the git module that allows pulling commits
   that aren't part of a branch
-  Many documentation additions and fixes.

1.8.4 "You Really Got Me" - Feb 19, 2015
----------------------------------------

-  Fixed regressions in ec2 and mount modules, introduced in 1.8.3

   information about a remote repo even if it doesn't exist locally.

1.8.1 "You Really Got Me" - Nov 26, 2014
----------------------------------------

-  Various bug fixes in postgresql and mysql modules.

   as syslog
-  ansible-galaxy install -f requirements.yml allows advanced options
   and installs from non-galaxy SCM sources and tarballs.
-  command\_warnings feature will warn about when usage of the
   shell/command module can be simplified to use core modules - this can
   be enabled in ansible.cfg
-  new omit value can be used to leave off a parameter when not set,
   like so module\_name: a=1 b={{ c \| default(omit) }}, would not pass
   value for b (not even an empty value) if c was not set.
-  developers: 'baby JSON' in module responses, originally intended for
   writing modules in bash, is removed as a feature to simplify logic,
   script module remains available for running bash scripts.
-  async jobs started in "fire & forget" mode can now be checked on at a
   later time.
-  added ability to subcategorize modules for docs.ansible.com
-  added ability for shipped modules to have aliases with symlinks
-  added ability to deprecate older modules by starting with "\_" and
   including "deprecated: message why" in module docs

New Modules:

Some other notable changes:

-  added the ability to set "instance filters" in the ec2.ini to limit
   results from the inventory plugin.
-  upgrades for various variable precedence items and parsing related
   items
-  added a new "follow" parameter to the file and copy modules, which
   allows actions to be taken on the target of a symlink rather than the
   symlink itself.
-  if a module should ever traceback, it will return a standard error,
   catchable by ignore\_errors, versus an 'unreachable'
-  ec2\_lc: added support for multiple new parameters like kernel\_id,
   ramdisk\_id and ebs\_optimized.
-  ec2\_elb\_lb: added support for the connection\_draining\_timeout and
   cross\_az\_load\_balancing options.
-  support for symbolic representations (ie. u+rw) for file permission
   modes (file/copy/template modules etc.).
-  docker: Added support for specifying the net type of the container.
-  docker: support for specifying read-only volumes.
-  docker: support for specifying the API version to use for the remote
   connection.

-  ec2\_ami\_search: support for SSD and IOPS provisioned EBS images
-  can set ansible\_sudo\_exe as an inventory variable which allows
   specifying a different sudo (or equivalent) command
-  git module: Submodule handling has changed. Previously if you used
   the ``recursive`` parameter to handle submodules, ansible would track
   the submodule upstream's head revision. This has been changed to
   checkout the version of the submodule specified in the superproject's
   git repository. This is inline with what git submodule update does.
   If you want the old behaviour use the new module parameter
   track\_submodules=yes
-  Checksumming of transferred files has been made more portable and now
   uses the sha1 algorithm instead of md5 to be compatible with
   FIPS-140.
-  As a small side effect, the fetch module no longer returns a useful
   value in remote\_md5. If you need a replacement, switch to using
   remote\_checksum which returns the sha1sum of the remote file.
-  ansible-doc CLI tool contains various improvements for working with
   different terminals

1.7 "Summer Nights" - Aug 06, 2014
----------------------------------

Major new features:

-  Windows support (alpha) using native PowerShell remoting

1.6.2 "And the Cradle Will Rock" - May 23, 2014
-----------------------------------------------

-  If an improper locale is specified, core modules will now
   automatically revert to using the 'C' locale.
-  Modules using the fetch\_url utility will now obey proxy environment
   variables.
-  The SSL validation step in fetch\_url will likewise obey proxy
   settings, however only proxies using the http protocol are supported.
-  Fixed multiple bugs in docker module related to version changes
   upstream.
-  Fixed a bug in the ec2\_group module where egress rules were lost
   when a VPC was specified.

Additional fixes for accelerate mode.

1.3.2 "Top of the World" (reprise) - September 19th, 2013
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------

Highlighted new features:

-  accelerated mode: An enhanced fireball mode that requires zero
   bootstrapping and fewer requirements plus adds capabilities like sudo
   commands.

   lowest priority. These variables can be overridden by any other
   variable.
-  new /etc/ansible/facts.d allows JSON or INI-style facts to be
   provided from the remote node, and supports executable fact programs
   in this dir. Files must end in \*.fact.

   (see ansible.cfg)
-  (DOCS PENDING) sudo: True/False and sudo\_user: True/False can be set
   at include and role level

-  external inventory scripts may now return host variables in one pass,
   which allows them to be much more efficient for large numbers of

1.2.3 "Hear About It Later" (reprise) -- Aug 21, 2013
-----------------------------------------------------

-  Local security fixes for predictable file locations for
   ControlPersist and retry file paths on shared machines on operating
   systems without kernel symlink/hardlink protections.

1.2.2 "Hear About It Later" (reprise) -- July 4, 2013
-----------------------------------------------------

-  Added a configuration file option [paramiko\_connection]
   record\_host\_keys which allows the code that paramiko uses to update
   known\_hosts to be disabled. This is done because paramiko can be
   very slow at doing this if you have a large number of hosts and some
   folks may not want this behavior. This can be toggled independently
   of host key checking and does not affect the ssh transport plugin.
   Use of the ssh transport plugin is preferred if you have
   ControlPersist capability, and Ansible by default in 1.2.1 and later
   will autodetect.

1.2.1 "Hear About It Later" -- July 4, 2013
-------------------------------------------

-  Connection default is now "smart", which discovers if the system
   openssh can support ControlPersist, and uses it if so, if not falls
   back to paramiko.
-  Host key checking is on by default. Disable it if you like by adding
   host\_key\_checking=False in the [default] section of
   /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg or ~/ansible.cfg or by exporting
   ANSIBLE\_HOST\_KEY\_CHECKING=False
-  Paramiko now records host keys it was in contact with host key
   checking is on. It is somewhat sluggish when doing this, so switch to
   the 'ssh' transport if this concerns you.

1.2 "Right Now" -- June 10, 2013
--------------------------------

Core Features:

-  capability to set 'all\_errors\_fatal: True' in a playbook to force
   any error to stop execution versus a whole group or serial block
   needing to fail usable, without breaking the ability to override in
   ansible
-  ability to use variables from {{ }} syntax in mainline playbooks, new
   'when' conditional, as detailed in documentation. Can disable old
   style replacements in ansible.cfg if so desired, but are still active
   by default.
-  can set ansible\_ssh\_private\_key\_file as an inventory variable
   (similar to ansible\_ssh\_host, etc)
-  'when' statement can be affixed to task includes to auto-affix the
   conditional to each task therein
-  cosmetic: "\*\*\*\*\*" banners in ansible-playbook output are now
   constant width
-  --limit can now be given a filename (--limit @filename) to constrain
   a run to a host list on disk
-  failed playbook runs will create a retry file in /var/tmp/ansible
   usable with --limit
-  roles allow easy arrangement of reusable
   tasks/handlers/files/templates
-  pre\_tasks and post\_tasks allow for separating tasks into blocks
   where handlers will fire around them automatically
-  "meta: flush\_handler" task capability added for when you really need
   to force handlers to run
-  new --start-at-task option to ansible playbook allows starting at a
   specific task name in a long playbook
-  added a log file for ansible/ansible-playbook, set 'log\_path' in the
   configuration file or ANSIBLE\_LOG\_PATH in environment
-  debug mode always outputs debug in playbooks, without needing to
   specify -v
-  external inventory script added for Spacewalk / Red Hat Satellite
   servers
-  It is now possible to feed JSON structures to --extra-vars. Pass in a
   JSON dictionary/hash to feed in complex data.
-  group\_vars/ and host\_vars/ directories can now be kept alongside
   the playbook as well as inventory (or both!)
-  more filters: ability to say {{ foo\|success }} and {{ foo\|failed }}
   and when: foo\|success and when: foo\|failed
-  more filters: {{ path\|basename }} and {{ path\|dirname }}
-  lookup plugins now use the basedir of the file they have included
   from, avoiding needs of ../../../ in places and increasing the ease
   at which things can be reorganized.

   newlines, small changes to templates may be required in rare cases.

Other playbook changes:

------------------------------------

Internals/Core \* internal inventory API now more object oriented,
parsers decoupled \* async handling improvements \* misc fixes for
running ansible on OS X (overlord only) \* sudo improvements, now works
much more smoothly \* sudo to a particular user with -U/--sudo-user, or
using 'sudo\_user: foo' in a playbook \* --private-key CLI option to
work with pem files

Inventory \* can use -i host1,host2,host3:port to specify hosts not in
inventory (replaces --override-hosts) \* ansible INI style format can do
groups of groups [groupname:children] and group vars [groupname:vars] \*
groups and users module takes an optional system=yes\|no on creation
(default no) \* list of hosts in playbooks can be expressed as a YAML
list in addition to ; delimited

Playbooks \* variables can be replaced like
${foo.nested\_hash\_key.nested\_subkey[array\_index]} \* unicode now ok
in templates (assumes utf8) \* able to pass host specifier or group name
in to "hosts:" with --extra-vars \* ansible-pull script and example
playbook (extreme scaling, remediation) \* inventory\_hostname variable

variables in the 'all' section can be used to define other variables
based on those values \* 'group\_names' is now a variable made available
to templates \* first\_available\_file feature, see
selective\_file\_sources.yml in examples/playbooks for info \*
--extra-vars="a=2 b=3" etc, now available to inject parameters into

playbooks, use $foo instead \* --override-hosts removed, can use -i with
comma notation (-i "ahost,bhost") \* modules can no longer include
stderr output (paramiko limitation from sudo)

Module Changes \* tweaks to SELinux implementation for file module \*
fixes for yum module corner cases on EL5 \* file module now correctly
returns the mode in octal \* fix for symlink handling in the file module

modules all now log to syslog \* enabled=yes\|no on a service can be
used to toggle chkconfig & updates-rc.d states \* git module supports
branch= \* service fixes to better detect status using return codes of
the service script \* custom facts provided by the setup module mean no
dependency on Ruby, facter, or ohai \* service now has a state=reloaded
